Here is a rundown of my mega REAPER setup that does the job of: 
- A live keys rig with 12 instruments, each with own volume fader
- "Panic button" that sends 'All notes off' and 'Pedal off' to armed instruments
- MPC style drum pad
- A looper with 8 stereo tracks

... and all of this controlled with a single MIDI controller. Although this one does have a lot of buttons and knobs!


Relying on a laptop for live performance can be a precarious thing, and with DAW-less setups becoming more compact and affordable, it's tempting to ditch your VSTs, sample libraries and start doing music on dedicated hardware.
